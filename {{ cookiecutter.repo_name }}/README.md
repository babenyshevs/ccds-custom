# How to create a project with coockie *cutter data science*

    cookiecutter https://github.com/babenyshevs/ccds-custom.git

# Steps to follow after creating/cloning a project
## create and activate virtual environment

    python -m venv .venv
    .venv/Scripts/activate

## create GIT repo (optional)
alternative way is to create a remote repository, clone it locally and copy create ccds project into it.

    git init

## initial commit to the new repo

    git add .
    git commit -m "default initial commit"

## checkout develop branch (optional)
for small project everything might be stored in master

    git checkout -b develop

## install requirements

install current project as a package

    python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel

before installing further open $requirements.txt$ and (un)comment packages, which you consider to be (ir)relevant for a given project. This will save some time (and disc space), packages can be added later if needed.  

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
